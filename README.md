I am a hard-working student with programming experience in Java, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and Python. I am seeking to earn a Bachelor of Science degree from a leading Computer Science university. I am interested in expanding my knowledge of software development. 
This repository includes: 
- Web scrapers
- Text analysis programs
- Physics simulators using Python and the Pymunk library. 
- Games such as Chess, Checkers, and 2048 with custom graphical user interfaces and logic.
- Image manipulation using the Pillow Python library.
